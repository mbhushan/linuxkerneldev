The kernel stores the list of processes in a circular doubly linked list called the task list. 2
Each element in the task list is a process descriptor of the type struct task_struct , which
is defined in <linux/sched.h> .The process descriptor contains all the information about
a specific process.

This maximum value is important because it is essentially the maximum number of
processes that may exist concurrently on the system.Although 32,768 might be sufficient
for a desktop system, large servers may require many more processes. Moreover, the lower
the value, the sooner the values will wrap around, destroying the useful notion that higher
values indicate later-run processes than lower values. If the system is willing to break com-
patibility with old applications, the administrator may increase the maximum value via
/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
