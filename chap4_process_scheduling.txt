PROCESS PRIORITY
===================================
the Linux operating system is preemptive.
You can see a list of the processes on your system and their respective nice values (under the column marked NI) with the command ps -el

The Linux kernel implements two separate priority ranges.The first is the nice value, a
number from –20 to +19 with a default of 0. Larger nice values correspond to a lower
priority—you are being “nice” to the other processes on the system. Processes with a
lower nice value (higher priority) receive a larger proportion of the system’s processor
compared to processes with a higher nice value (lower priority).

The second range is the real-time priority.The values are configurable, but by default
range from 0 to 99, inclusive.

You can see a list of the processes on your system and their respective real-time priority (under the column marked RTPRIO) 
with the command
ps -eo state,uid,pid,ppid,rtprio,time,comm .
A value of “-” means the process is not real-time.
