It is imperative that you utilize the source.The open availability of the source code
for the Linux system is a rare gift that you must not take for granted. It is not sufficient
only to read the source, however.You need to dig in and change some code. 
Find a bug and fix it. Improve the drivers for your hardware. Add some new functionality, even if it
is trivial. Find an itch and scratch it! Only when you write code will it all come together.
